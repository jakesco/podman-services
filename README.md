# Podman Services Collection

A collection of scrips for building services in podman containers. Requires `buildah` and `podman`. Many of these use base images are from DockerHub and can be converted to Docker containers by translating the `buildah` commands to a `Dockerfile`.

## Containers

* [A Dark Room](https://github.com/doublespeakgames/adarkroom): A fun idle game running in browser. Good for simple web testing.
* *LAMP*: A basic PHP - MYSQL setup.
